# Weather Data Analysis using DBSCAN

![Weather Data Analysis using DBSCAN](https://github.com/sneh2909/weather-data/blob/main/images/weather_dbscan.png)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named `DBSCAN on data.ipynb`, which demonstrates the application of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) on weather data. The goal of this analysis is to utilize unsupervised learning techniques to form clusters based on the density of data points in the weather dataset.

## Introduction

DBSCAN is a popular clustering algorithm that groups data points based on their density in the feature space. It is particularly useful for datasets that may contain noise and do not have a fixed number of clusters. In this project, we apply DBSCAN to weather data to discover meaningful patterns and group similar weather conditions.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook and experiment with the code, you need to have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sneh2909/weather-data.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd weather-data
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `DBSCAN on data.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

2. Run the cells sequentially to see the step-by-step analysis and application of DBSCAN on the weather data.

3. The notebook contains detailed explanations and comments to guide you through the code and the results.
